            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <!-- Choose up to three typefaces. If you have more than three - what is each one being used for? -->
            <div class="type type-1">
                <p class="big-example">ABCDEabcde123 Il1 handgloves</p>
                <p>The wily fox jumped over the lazy dog. </p>
                <p class="why">This typeface is used for our logo banner text. We chose Effra Light because its serif style is sleek, modern and attractive to a younger generation as it is similar to that of Apple's brand font. We also use this font as our paragraph tag font as it is easy to distiguish letters when reading which is paramount for user experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="type type-2">
                <p class="big-example">ABCDEabcde123 Il1 handgloves</p>
                <p>The wily fox jumped over the lazy dog. </p>
                <p class="why">This typeface is used for our H1 headings as well as information we wish to be highlighted to our user as it is much bolder than Effra Light. We also chose Effra Regular as it is in the same font family as our Effra Light. </p>
